* Ignore these notebooks ( Just for reference )

## What's missing

* Bert+lda - Tried by weights of top text (not complete)
* linearsvc+onevsrest - Good job(0.43 after preprocessing) ( But there is no option to calculate probability in linearsvc to blend with others )
* lstm+glove - Overfit (showing predictions of neutral only)
* networkx+cosine - This is good approach but i don't have enough time to use it further with model ( Tried at -2 hr )
